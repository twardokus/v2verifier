Web\+GL front-\/end GUI for V2\+Verifier testbed. This interface shows real-\/time vehicle location, motion, and direction of travel (as shown below) rendered on a 3D map built from \href{https://openstreetmap.org}{\texttt{ Open\+Street\+Map}} data.

\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Installation}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
{\itshape You will need a \href{https://www.mapbox.com/}{\texttt{ mapbox}} key in order to render the GUI. Obtain a key (available for free) from \href{https://www.mapbox.com/}{\texttt{ mapbox}}, and store it in a file called {\ttfamily key.\+js} in the {\ttfamily osm-\/gui/open-\/street-\/map-\/gui/webapp/scripts} directory.}

Open a terminal and {\ttfamily cd} into {\ttfamily osm-\/gui} directory. Create a new Python virtual environment (e.\+g., with {\ttfamily virtualenv}) and activate it.

Install dependencies with \begin{DoxyVerb}pip install -r requirements.txt
\end{DoxyVerb}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Usage}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
To run the GUI itself, open a separate terminal and {\ttfamily cd} into the {\ttfamily open-\/street-\/map-\/gui} subdirectory. Launce the GUI (it will open in Google Chrome, if installed) with \begin{DoxyVerb}python gui.py
\end{DoxyVerb}
 In the original terminal, run the sample program that renders synthetic vehicle data on the GUI with \begin{DoxyVerb}python main.py
\end{DoxyVerb}

This is an in-\/progress and heavily under development component of the larger \href{https://github.com/twardokus/v2verifier}{\texttt{ V2\+Verifier}} project. Currently, our GUI is built largely in Javascript, with data from Open\+Stree\+Maps rendered using Web\+GL and the \href{https://www.mapbox.com/}{\texttt{ mapbox}} toolkit.
