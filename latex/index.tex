 $\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\+Important$\ast$$\ast$ -\/ this version of V2\+Verifier is a {\itshape preliminary} release of V2\+Verifier 3.\+0. As we await bug fixes in third-\/party open-\/source projects that V2\+Verifier relies on for C-\/\+V2X sidelink communication, {\bfseries{this version of V2\+Verifier temporarily does not support C-\/\+V2X}}. We thank you for your patience as we work towards resolving this issue.$\ast$$\ast$

V2\+Verifer is an open-\/source testbed for experimental evaluation of security in vehicle-\/to-\/vehicle (V2V) communication. V2\+Verifier supports a broad range of experimentation with V2V technologies and security protocols using a combination of software-\/defined radios (e.\+g., USRPs) and commercial V2V equipment. Among other features, V2\+Verifier includes implementations of\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Security features from the IEEE 1609.\+2 standard for V2V security, including message signing and verification and V2V certificates
\item WAVE Short Message Protocol (IEEE 1609.\+3)
\item Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) -\/ adapted from the \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2017.2751474}{\texttt{ Wi\+ME Project\textquotesingle{}s}} IEEE 802.\+11p transceiver
\item \sout{Cellular Vehicle-\/to-\/\+Everything (C-\/\+V2X) -\/ based on the \href{https://github.com/srsRAN/srsRAN}{\texttt{ srs\+RAN}} project (formerly srs\+LTE)} (temporarily not supported -\/ see above)
\end{DoxyItemize}

V2\+Verifier is developed and maintained in the \href{https://www.rit.edu/wisplab/}{\texttt{ Wireless and IoT Security and Privacy (WISP)}} lab at Rochester Institute of Technology\textquotesingle{}s \href{https://rit.edu/cybersecurity}{\texttt{ Global Cybersecurity Institute}}.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{Citing V2\+Verifier}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
If you use V2\+Verifier or any of its components in your work, please cite \href{https://github.com/twardokus/v2verifier/wiki/Publications}{\texttt{ our paper}} from IEEE ICC 2021. Additional publications involving V2\+Verifier are listed on the same page.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Equipment Requirements}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
V2\+Verifier is designed for over-\/the-\/air experiments with software-\/defined radios (SDRs). For C-\/\+V2X, you {\itshape {\bfseries{must}}} use SDRs with GPSDO modules installed. We recommend the USRP B210 and TCXO GPSDO module from Ettus Research (we have not tested and do not officially support the use of other SDRs for C-\/\+V2X). For DSRC, you may use USRP B210s (GPSDO not required for DSRC) or, preferably, USRP N210s (also available from Ettus Research). If you are using N210s, a 6 GHz daughterboard (e.\+g., UBX 40) is required for each N210 device.

If you do not have access to SDRs, V2\+Verifier can also be run as a pure simulation environment that only requires a modern PC to run. With or without SDRs, we strongly discourage the use of virtual machines as this may incur testbed-\/breaking latency. Ubuntu 20.\+04 is currently the only supported operating system. {\bfseries{Windows operating systems are not supported.}}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Installing V2\+Verifier}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
Installation consists of two parts.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{Part 1 -\/ V2\+V Protocols}\label{index_autotoc_md4}
Follow the instructions for DSRC, C-\/\+V2X, or both to install the software needed for your PC to communicate with your software-\/defined radios and send V2V messages over the air.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsubsection{C-\/\+V2X}\label{index_autotoc_md5}
V2\+Verifier\textquotesingle{}s implementation of C-\/\+V2X sidelink communication is based on the open-\/source srs\+RAN project.

{\itshape C-\/\+V2X support has been temporarily removed as we await bug fixes in third-\/party code that V2\+Verifier relies on. Thank you for your patience as we work to restore this functionality as soon as possible.}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsubsection{DSRC}\label{index_autotoc_md6}
V2\+Verifier\textquotesingle{}s implementation of DSRC is based on the open-\/source GNURadio and Wi\+ME Project implementation of IEEE 802.\+11p.

\href{https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio}{\texttt{ GNURadio}} version 3.\+10 is required to run DSRC experiments in V2\+Verifier. Additionally, GNURadio modules from the \href{https://www.wime-project.net/}{\texttt{ Wi\+ME project}} are required. Install GNURadio as well as the required Wi\+ME modules with the following commands. If you encounter any errors, please visit the GNURadio project on Git\+Hub for their most recent installation instructions and troubleshooting guide. \begin{DoxyVerb}pip install pybombs
pybombs auto-config
pybombs recipes add-defaults
pybombs prefix init ~/gr-3.10 -R gnuradio-default
\end{DoxyVerb}
 To finish configuring the environment and ensure installation was successful, execute the following commands to run GNURadio Companion. \begin{DoxyVerb}source ~/gr-3.10/setup_env.sh
gnuradio-companion
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Now, install the Wi\+ME project code. You will need to install from source, as the {\ttfamily pybombs} installation method (e.\+g., {\ttfamily pybombs install gr-\/foo}) will likely fail due to Swig issues in GNURadio 3.\+10. \begin{DoxyVerb}cd ~
git clone https://github.com/bastibl/gr-foo.git
cd gr-foo
git checkout maint-3.10
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig

cd ~
git clone https://github.com/bastibl/gr-ieee802-11.git
cd gr-ieee802-11
git checkout maint-3.10
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../
make
sudo make install 
sudo ldconfig
\end{DoxyVerb}
 You can confirm everything installed correctly by launching GNURadio Companion and opening the flowgraph file at {\ttfamily $\sim$/gr-\/ieee802-\/11/examples/wifi-\/loopback.grc}. If you encounter any errors, some of the above commands did not work correctly. Do not proceed until you have fixed any issues running the example flowgraph.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsection{Part 2 -\/ V2\+Verifier}\label{index_autotoc_md7}
Now that you have installed the communication software, you can install V2\+Verifier. Begin by installing several dependencies\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}sudo apt install -y git cmake libuhd-dev uhd-host swig libgmp3-dev python3-pip python3-tk python3-pil 
python3-pil.imagetk 
\end{DoxyVerb}
 If you have not already cloned the V2\+Verifier repository, do so with the commands \begin{DoxyVerb}cd ~
git clone https://github.com/twardokus/v2verifier.git
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Move into the V2\+Verifier directory and build the project using the standard CMake build process\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}cd v2verifier
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
\end{DoxyVerb}
 If you have missed any dependencies, CMake will warn you at this point. Once V2\+Verifier is built, proceed to the next section for instructions on how to run experiments in V2\+Verifier.

Finally, download the ZIP file for the latest stable release of V2\+Verifier, extract the project, and you are ready to start using V2\+Verifier!\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{Running V2\+Verifier}\label{index_autotoc_md8}
Before running V2\+Verifier, connect one USRP (with appropriate antennas) to each Ubuntu PC. Assuming you have two PCs with one USRP each, designate one USRP as the \char`\"{}receiver\char`\"{} and the other as the \char`\"{}transmitter.\char`\"{} In this configuration, the receiver will show you how a single vehicle responds to V2V transmissions (e.\+g., using a GUI) while the transmitter can generate V2V traffic for up to ten vehicles. You can specify the number of vehicles by changing the relevant parameter in {\ttfamily config.\+json}.

On each PC, begin by launching the C-\/\+V2X or DSRC code (follow the respective instructions below) to run in the background and manage your SDR transmitting or receiving. Then, on each PC, {\ttfamily cd} into the {\ttfamily build} directory. For the receiver, run the command \begin{DoxyVerb}./src/v2verifier dsrc receiver [--test] [--gui]
\end{DoxyVerb}
 For the transmitter, run the command \begin{DoxyVerb}./src/v2verifier dsrc transmitter [--test]
\end{DoxyVerb}
 See the command-\/line help ({\ttfamily ./v2verifier -\/h}) for optional arguments. You should not use the {\ttfamily -\/-\/test} option unless you are not using SDRs (this option allows you to run transmitter and receiver on a single PC with communication via network socket). Use {\ttfamily -\/-\/gui} on the receiver if you want to use a graphical interface on the receiver (see additional instructions for GUIs below).\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsection{Radio layer\+: C-\/\+V2X}\label{index_autotoc_md9}
{\itshape Note C-\/\+V2X communication requires equipment capable of both cellular communication and GPS clock synchronization (e.\+g., USRP B210 w/ GPSDO or \href{https://cohdawireless.com/solutions/hardware/mk6c-evk/}{\texttt{ Cohda Wireless MK6c}}) as well as access to either an outdoor testing environment or synthesized GPS source.}

{\bfseries{C-\/\+V2X support has been temporarily removed as we await bug fixes in third-\/party code that V2\+Verifier relies on. Thank you for your patience as we work to restore this functionality as soon as possible.}}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysubsection{Radio layer\+: DSRC}\label{index_autotoc_md10}
On both PCs, launch GNURadio with {\ttfamily pybombs run gnuradio-\/companion}. On one PC, open the {\ttfamily wifi\+\_\+tx.\+grc} file from the {\ttfamily v2verifier/grc} project subdirectory. On the other PC, open the {\ttfamily wifi\+\_\+rx.\+grc} file from the same subdirectory. Click the green play button at the top of GNURadio to launch the flowgraphs on both PCs. You will need to configure the communication options (e.\+g., bandwith, frequency) to suit your needs. The default is a 10 MHz channel on 5.\+89 GHz.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysubsection{Using GUIs}\label{index_autotoc_md11}
V2\+Verifier currently offers two graphical interfaces. The first is a web-\/based interface that interacts with Google Maps. To use this GUI, you will need to purchase a Google Maps API key through Google Cloud services and create {\ttfamily config.\+js} file in the {\ttfamily web} directory of V2\+Verifier (some familiarity with Java\+Script is helpful). Please contact us for assistance if you want to use this GUI.

Our second interface is based on Tk\+GUI. To use this option, open a separate terminal window before running any {\ttfamily v2verifier} commands above and run {\ttfamily python3 tkgui\+\_\+execute.\+py} to launch the Tk\+GUI interface as a separate process.

We encourage you to open a Git\+Hub issue with any questions or problems using either graphical interface.
